# react-contact-list

This was a tutorial to learn basic functions of the React language.  It was a basic CRUD app built with React, Axios for calls, a json placeholder website for a mock database, and usage of the Context methods. The basic functions of the app will list all contacts. There is a button to edit the data and shows the updated info.  There is an add button which successfully adds the contact to the top of the list and gives an id on the mock database.  There is a delete button to remove from the mock database. There display is just a name until the show button is clicked. A dropdown menu displays the phone number and the email of the contact. The button are linked to specific pages.  There is even an about page to show the version of this app.  There is also a 404 page if there is an error within the app.  The project implemented the Context method, like a Redux light.  A context page was made where the state was created and put in a provider component.  It made it possible to share the data with other pages with a reducer.  It was a simple app, but covered most of the basics of React.
